# MyUtilities
COMMON LISP UTILITIES written in LispWorks.  Some of these utility files are used in ALL my apps and branches. Check with the config files within the applications to see which of these files are required for that particular application.
This is a collection of my utilities filed by purpose, etc.  Eg. U-files.lisp has utilities for managing files;  U-tstring.lisp can do a lot with strings;l U-lists.lisp has a large collection of powerful list managing, searching, etc. that can also make very complex data bases if desired. ETC. File names fairly well describe the types of functions useful for many applications.
